# AI Guard Agent
An intelligent, voice-activated guard for a hostel room security, featuring robust face recognition and an escalating, LLM-powered conversational agent.

## Overview

This project is an advanced AI Guard Agent designed to monitor a college hostel room using a standard laptop's webcam and microphone. The agent activates on a voice command, uses a robust machine learning model to distinguish between trusted individuals and strangers, and engages with unrecognized persons through a series of escalating, context-aware spoken warnings generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).
The system is built with a high-performance, multi-threaded architecture to ensure a responsive and seamless user experience.

### Key Features
* **Vocal Activation:** The agent is activated and deactivated using simple voice commands ("guard my room" / "stand down").

**Robust Face Recognition:** Utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on multiple images per person for high-accuracy recognition, even under varying conditions.

**Real-time Visual Feedback:** A pop-up camera window displays the live feed, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces and showing the predicted identity along with the model's confidence score.

**Context-Aware Intruder Dialogue:** When an unrecognized person is detected, the agent initiates an escalating conversation with prompts specifically designed for a hostel environment, powered by the Groq LLM with Llama 3.1.

**High-Performance Design:** The application is multi-threaded, separating the continuous voice command listener from the main vision processing loop. This ensures the vision system starts instantly upon activation and remains highly responsive.

**Polished User Experience:** Includes graceful shutdown procedures, clear status messages, and robust error handling for audio and hardware.

## System Architecture

The agent operates on a state-based logic flow, integrating multiple AI modalities:

**Speech Recognition (ASR):** A background thread continuously listens for activation or deactivation commands.

**State Management:** Upon receiving a valid command, the system's state (guard_mode_active) is changed.

**Computer Vision:** When active, the main thread processes the webcam feed. It detects faces and uses the pre-trained SVM classifier to identify individuals.

**LLM Interaction:** If an unrecognized person is detected, the system generates a context-specific prompt and sends it to the Groq LLM.

## File Structure:


## Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

### 1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone <your-repo-url>

cd <your-repo-folder>

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended)
This isolates the project's dependencies from your system's Python installation.



## How to Run the Application
### Step 1: Configure the API Key
Before running, you must add your secret Groq API key.
 
Open the main_guard_system_final.py file.
Find the line GROQ_API_KEY = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
Replace "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY" with the key you obtained from the Groq Console.
