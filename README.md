# AI Guard Agent
An intelligent, voice-activated guard for a hostel room security, featuring robust face recognition and an escalating, LLM-powered conversational agent.

## Overview

This project is an advanced AI Guard Agent designed to monitor a college hostel room using a standard laptop's webcam and microphone. The agent activates on a voice command, uses a robust machine learning model to distinguish between trusted individuals and strangers, and engages with unrecognized persons through a series of escalating, context-aware spoken warnings generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).
The system is built with a high-performance, multi-threaded architecture to ensure a responsive and seamless user experience.

## Key Features
Vocal Activation: The agent is activated and deactivated using simple voice commands ("guard my room" / "stand down").

Robust Face Recognition: Utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on multiple images per person for high-accuracy recognition, even under varying conditions.

Real-time Visual Feedback: A pop-up camera window displays the live feed, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces and showing the predicted identity along with the model's confidence score.

Context-Aware Intruder Dialogue: When an unrecognized person is detected, the agent initiates an escalating conversation with prompts specifically designed for a hostel environment, powered by the Groq LLM with Llama 3.1.

High-Performance Design: The application is multi-threaded, separating the continuous voice command listener from the main vision processing loop. This ensures the vision system starts instantly upon activation and remains highly responsive.

Polished User Experience: Includes graceful shutdown procedures, clear status messages, and robust error handling for audio and hardware.
System Architecture

The agent operates on a state-based logic flow, integrating multiple AI modalities:

Speech Recognition (ASR): A background thread continuously listens for activation or deactivation commands.

State Management: Upon receiving a valid command, the system's state (guard_mode_active) is changed.

Computer Vision: When active, the main thread processes the webcam feed. It detects faces and uses the pre-trained SVM classifier to identify individuals.

LLM Interaction: If an unrecognized person is detected, the system generates a
